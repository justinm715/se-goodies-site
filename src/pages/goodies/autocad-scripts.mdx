A collection of AutoCAD functions.

<h2 class="text-3xl font-weight-700 mt-6 ">Extract Grid Points</h2>

Establish the project grid quickly in RISA by copying over AutoCAD grid line endpoints.

<ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-4">
  <li>
    In RISA, set Z-axis up (opposite gravity) and units to inches (or feet).
  </li>
  <li>
    In AutoCAD, set your origin point (0,0) with <Code>UCS</Code> and units as decimal
    inches (or feet, just be consistent with RISA) with 0.000 precision with <Code>UNITS</Code>. The origin is typically
    at the lower left of plan view with X positive to the right and Y positive
    up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the grid lines you want and run <Code>EXTRACTGRIDPOINTS</Code>. The
    grid lines must be individual line objects (e.g., not in a block, group, or
    external reference).
  </li>
  <li>
    The function will record each line's start and end X and Y coordinates and
    save it to <Code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\temp.txt</Code>. You can copy and paste these directly into the RISA Project Grid spreadsheet. Update the grid labels as appropriate for the project.
  </li>
</ol>
